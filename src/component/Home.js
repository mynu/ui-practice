            <p>We are a technology company first, but with a major focus on consumer well-being through a healthy diet.
                Most people are very busy with their jobs, family and friends, and other important activities, which
                doesn't leave much time for cooking. This might lead to a poor diet and lasting health consequences.
                We want to solve this problem by using an AI-centric approach. Users can use our app to select their
                diet and foods they like and dislike, and our AI algorithm will create a custom and individual weekly
                meal plan. But we don't stop there. We partner with restaurants and other cooking partners to actually
                cook and deliver all meals from the generated meal plans, in selected cities. All this will be packed
                up in a monthly subscription, where users can choose between receiving one or two meals per day, every
                single day of the month.
